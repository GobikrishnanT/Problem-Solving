# Problem-Solving

### 1 . Frequency Counter : 
Examble : 
Array1 = [1 , 2, 3];
Array2 = [1 , 4 , 9];

Our Problem is to find if every value in thar array have the corresponding square value in the second array :

How i solved this problem ?
let create two obj :
one for array 1 to note occurence of each character 
same for second array 

And then check if every key-value of myObj1 is in the myObj2 
Note : if the key value is pair there we have to check for the occurence of that character in myObj2
Examble : 
Array1 = [1 , 2 , 2 , 3];
Array2 = [1 , 4 , 2 , 9];

See here in Array 1 we have two 2 but in array 2 we have only one four so it is not valid there:

### 2 . Anagram Challenge :
I have used the above algorithm to solve these problem too.
